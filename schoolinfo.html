      I am a 300 level Computer Science student at Edwin Clark University
      specializing in IT as a young individual with a growing interest in
      technology and its applications. I have a solid foundation in programming,
      data structures, and algorithms, and would be starting to delve deeper
      into IT-specific subjects. I might be exploring areas like networking,
      database management, or software engineering. I am probably balancing
      academic coursework with practical projects and internships to gain
      hands-on experience. Given the university's location in the Niger Delta,
      they might also have a keen interest in how technology can address
      regional challenges. Overall, i am likely a problem-solver with a knack
      for logical thinking, eager to apply my knowledge to real-world IT
      solutions.
